# Description:
Here is a description of our proyect: A snail falls into a well 20 meters deep and hangs on to the wall of the well between the 10 and 20 meters below ground.
Every day he climbs some and falls a little, but he will grow more tired as the days pass which will make him climb less per day, and depending on the weather the water will be rising to catch him, also, when a car passes by the well, the snail fall some more because of the vibrations the car  generates.

Will the snail get out of the well before he dies of starvation on the fiftieth day or falls to the water due to the rain?
# Functions list:
- [x] Function 1: Snail's movement
 
The snail's movement is determined in a range and depending on how long he's been trapped inside the well that range will decrease, going from 1 to 4 meters upwards until day 10, past day 11 and until day 20 the snail will move from 1 to 3 meters upwards. Finally, past day 20 the snail will move 1 or 2 meters upwards. Furthermore, every night he has the probability of either falling up to 2 meters, or not falling at all

- [x] Function 2: Car

Every day, there's a 35% chance of a car passing by the well, provoking an earthquake that will make the snail fall 2 meters apart from the ones he falls every night


- [x] Function 3: Rain

There are three different weathers that can be: clear weather with an 85% of probability, then there's light rain with a 10% of probability which makes the water level rise 2 meters, and lastly, there's a 5% of probability of heavy rain, which will raise the water level 5 meters

I (as the owner of the repository fork), gave edit permissions to Miguel and José, so they were able to commit their changes directly, instead of having to PR. This is due to a problem regarding the ability to make PRs as a non-owner.
